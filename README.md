# Plausibility-in-Visual-Language-Processing
An eye-tracking study using young adults (18-35 years old) that examined how readers process meaning across their 'useful field of view' during reading on a screen
Eye-Tracking & Language Processing Analysis
Project Overview
This repository contains data processing and analysis scripts for an eye-tracking study on language comprehension. The project involved statistical modeling of eye movement data to examine how readers process linguistic stimuli in real time.

Key Features & Tools
âœ… Eye-tracking data analysis using lme4 for mixed-effects modeling
âœ… Automated data preprocessing to ensure model stability and convergence
âœ… Stimuli generation scripts for psycholinguistic experiments
âœ… Reproducible statistical modeling with documented workflow

Repository Structure
ðŸ“‚ /analysis â€“ Scripts for eye movement data modeling (R, lme4)
ðŸ“‚ /stimuli â€“ Stimuli norming scripts & experimental materials
ðŸ“‚ /data â€“ Sample dataset for replicating analyses

How to Use This Repository
Set up your environment: Ensure lme4 is installed in R for mixed-effects modeling.
Run the analysis script to replicate findings or adapt the workflow for similar datasets.
Use the stimuli generation scripts to create customized experimental materials.
